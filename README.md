## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v16 or higher).
- Python (v3.8 or higher) for the backend (if using Django).
- PostgreSQL database.
- Docker (optional, for containerization).

### **Frontend Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/knowledge-base-app.git
   cd knowledge-base-app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

### **Backend Setup**
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
5. The backend API will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/api
   ```

### **Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
# Frontend
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000/api

# Backend
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/knowledgebase
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

## **Example Workflow**
1. A developer encounters a bug and finds a solution.
2. They log in to the knowledge base and POST the solution with relevant tags (e.g., “JavaScript,” “Bug Fix”).
3. Other team members search for similar issues and find the solution.
4. They upvote the solution and add comments for clarification.
5. The solution becomes a trusted resource for future reference.
